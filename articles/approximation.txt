    approximating a degree of boolean function
X https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343321795_Quantum_algorithms_for_learning_the_algebraic_normal_form_of_quadratic_Boolean_functions
    seems to be quadratic only

    construction of specific boolean functions
O https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/35317526.pdf [something with ANF]
    there is no approximation or something like that
O https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1446.pdf [creating specific functions]
    something with annihilators ?, boolean functions with certain characteristics

X thesisAn_p.pdf Cryptographic properties of boolean functions and S-boxes [construction of small boolean functions]
    some properties and creating new boolean functions
D https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/587.pdf [ANF with key monomials]
    seems really good, too specific and no explanation
D https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308066449_Hacking_of_the_AES_with_Boolean_Functions [boolean functions in ANF from AES]
    seems really good, it is again from the whole truth table
O https://lucamariot.org/files/slides/talk_durham_2019.pdf [slide 13 and sources]
    it is more about construction than reconstruction - but try to look at it
? https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31662-3_7 [probably the whole function - big complexity]
X http://www2.uaem.mx/r-mirror/web/packages/boolfun/vignettes/boolfun.pdf [some basics with algorithm for ANF]

O https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1048.pdf [by cube-attack guys]
    look at it, is monomial there? -> recovered balanced superpoly
A https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01023.pdf [Boolean network]
    part 3 seems like the thing we want
X http://www2.fiit.stuba.sk/~kvasnicka/Free%20books/Brown_Boolean%20Reasoning.pdf [a lot of things]
    it is too much and I do not think it is what we want

    there are interesting examples
